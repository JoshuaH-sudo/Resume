# Resume
This repo is design to showcase my work and share my experience from my professional career as a software developer.

You are more than welcome to look at the other repos on my account, as they contain personal projects that utilize the experience I have gained through my job. However, as they are personal works, they are not always adhering to the best code practices. 

The code I provide in this repo, is the best demonstration of my skills and the quality of work I should be expected to deliver.

## Code Snippet Structure
Each folder contains code snippets from various projects that I have been apart. Each folder will contain some code snippets and a README file. Explaining why I have included them, what they were a part of, and the challenges involved in each of them.

These snippets have been sanitized of any relation to their projects and I have been granted permission to showcase them in my resume.
